The following lines explain the order of use of the files attached to this project
Step 1:
-open the notebook named training_forecasting_models
-import the data from the "Raw data_Bxl" file into namefile
-vary n from 1 to 4 whereas H from 1 to 10
-save the results for each successive variation of n and H for example n=2 and H=1 we have MSEn2h1.pdata

Step 2:
-open the notebook named statistical_tests
-import the data from "df" for each model
-run the codes to display the heatmap tables
-import the files named "dfH1,dfH2,dfH3,dfH4 and dfH8" from the "df" folder 
-run the codes to display the bar charts of the MSEs for each model
-run the codes to display the results of the Friedman, Nemenyi and Bonferroni-Dunn tests
